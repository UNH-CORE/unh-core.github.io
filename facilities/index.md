The UNH Center for Ocean Renewable Energy (CORE) physical infrastructure is unique in terms 
of proximity, ease of access, and favorable test site characteristics. It consists of the 
Chase Ocean Engineering (OE) Laboratory with wave/tow tank, engineering tank and water and 
wind tunnels, the General Sullivan Bridge tidal energy site, the UNH Pier and the AMAC/wave 
energy site.  Mooring grids, historical environmental and survey data, and support vessels 
are readily available.

The map above shows key sites of the Center for Ocean Renewable Energy (CORE), University of New 
Hampshire: Ocean Engineering Laboratory, Tidal and Wave Energy Test Sites, UNH Pier (staging, 
support vessels). Note the geographic proximity (horizontal bar = 2.5 miles). (Click on image to

Tidal Energy Test Site
----------------------
The UNH tidal energy test site is at the General Sullivan Bridge where the Lower Piscataqua 
enters Little Bay through a constriction. The tidal range is nominally 8.2 ft (2.5 m), and 
approximately 40 percent of the volume of Great Bay flows under the bridge every tidal cycle. 
This results in peak current speeds of greater than 4 knots (2 m/s), as well as relatively 
short periods of slack water and a steep current speed ramp-up. UNH-CORE faculty have modeled 
the dynamics of this tidal system in several studies. This site is considered a full-scale 
test site for vertical axis turbines, while it can be considered a “large-scale” test site 
(geometric scale 1:3-1:5) for large diameter horizontal axis turbines.

Wave Energy Test Site
---------------------
The wave energy test site is located at the UNH Atlantic Marine Aquaculture (AMAC) site, 
which covers an area of 30 acres in 170 ft (52 m) of water approximately 6 miles from the 
New Hampshire coast. It has been successfully deployed under extreme New England winter 
conditions as a demonstration site for open ocean aquaculture for the past 10 years. The 
site has a subsurface mooring system and a large feed buoy (AMAC) is available as a useable 
platform and a potential end user load for any wave energy extraction device. The site comes 
with a dedicated 50 ft research vessel (Meriel B). Available environmental data consisting 
of wave monitoring, benthic and water column environmental data, and bathymetry obtained by 
the UNH Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping (C-COM) will be essential for the quick successful 
deployment of a given energy extraction device, and makes this a cost effective wave energy 
test site.
