This article, published in the Marine Technology Society Journal, describes a theoretical
and experimental investigation into the wake of an axial-flow turbine in a wind tunnel.

## Abstract
Energy production data from several of the existing large offshore wind farms
indicate that turbine arrays can suffer from a significant overall energy production
shortfall, due to wakes generated by turbines upstream interacting with turbines
downstream. An experimental investigation of the axial and azimuthal (swirl) velocity
field in the wake of a single three-bladed wind turbine with rotor diameter of 0.91 m
was conducted. The turbinewas positioned in the free stream, near the entrance of the
6 m Ã— 2.7 m cross section of the UNH Flow Physics Facility, a 72-m-long boundary
layer wind tunnel. The turbine model was tested at various rotor loading conditions
with blade tip-speed ratios up to 2.8. A Pitot-static tube and constant temperature hotwire
anemometry with a multiwire sensor were used to obtain velocity field measurements
in the wake of themodel turbine up to 20 diameters downstream. The results of
an equilibriumsimilarity theory for the axisymmetric wake with rotation are presented.
The measurements obtained were used to examine the validity of the derived scaling
functions for streamwise and azimuthal velocity, wake growth, and turbulence.
