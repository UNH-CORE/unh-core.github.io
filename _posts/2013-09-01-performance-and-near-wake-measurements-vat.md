This paper, published in the proceedings of the 2013 ASME Fluids Engineering Division Summer Meeting (FEDSM2013),
details experimental measurements of performance and near-wake characteristics for a vertical axis turbine
at moderate Reynolds number. 

## Abstract
Experiments were performed with a 1 m diameter, 1 m
tall three-bladed vertical axis turbine in a towing tank. Rotor
power and drag (or thrust) were measured at a tow speed of
1 m/s, corresponding to a turbine diameter Reynolds number
$$Re_D = 10^6$$ and an approximate blade chord Reynolds number
$$Re_c = \lambda U_\infty c/\nu \sim 10^5$$. Mechanical exergy efficiency estimates
were computed from power and drag measurements using an actuator
disk approach. Characteristics of the turbine’s near-wake
were measured at one turbine diameter downstream. Variation
of all three mean and fluctuating velocity components in the vertical
and cross-stream directions were measured at peak turbine
power output via acoustic Doppler velocimeter. The effect of
tip speed ratio on near-wake mean velocity was observed at the
turbine center line. Transverse profiles of mean velocity, fluctuating
velocity, and Reynolds stresses were also measured at the
turbine’s quarter height for two tip speed ratios of interest. Results
are compared and contrasted with previous lower Reynolds
number studies, and will provide a detailed data set for validation
of numerical models.
